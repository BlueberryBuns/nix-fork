# The Big Nix Adventure

## TODO

[ ] Find a better way to refer to my existing dotfiles repo
    [ ] currently using https://github.com/winston0410/universal-dotfiles/blob/master/modules/bin/neovim.nix
    [ ] flakify the dotfiles repo?
    [ ] Nice workflow? I dont want to do `nix flake update` for every nvim
    change
    [ ] Ideally no submodules as those make it harder to manage dots
    [ ] Maybe the current bare repo is perfect?
    [ ] Maybe I have to bite the bullet and maintain 2 repos?

[ ] Expand home manager modules

[ ] Expand nixos modules

[ ] Seperate nixos and home-manager flake outputs, so that a user change doesnt
require a new system
